## Statistical Tools for Analysis
### 1. **Paired t-Test** <br>
   $$t =   \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_d}{S_d * \sqrt(n)}$$
   where,<br>
         $\bar{d}$ = sample mean difference<br>
         $\mu_d$ = population mean difference<br>
         $S_d$ = standard deviation of sample difference<br>
         n = sample size<br>
### 2. **Time Series** <br>
  - **Exponential Smoothing** <br>
      Exponential Smoothing is a time series forecasting method for univariate data.
  - **Trendline(Graphical Represntion)** <br>
      The trend is a general tendency of data to increase or decrease over a period of time. Using graphical representation we can observe the trend of data.

## Conclusion
   - Using **Paired t-test** we found that, although large-cap stocks are known for being less volatile, we saw volatility during Covid19, and through **Time-Series** we found that we can see no effect of Covid19 in a longer time frame. Thus, Large-cap stocks are said to have good stability over pandemics and some disasters.
